  <div class="bgtexture">Fedya Nozdrin is a <span class='bgasterisk'>*</span>young designer from Moscow, Russia. A father, a husband, a bookworm and a digital designer, the young lad has still many things to unveil to the design <span class='bgasterisk'>**</span>loving community. Although he claims that the classical preparation in one of Moscow's most acclaimed poligraphy schools didn't do much for his further professional growth, the world sees it differently: Fedya might shudder at the single thought of drawing another Socrates head, but a lot of his knowledge in composition, light and mood originate in classical drawing and endless hours of observation (however tedious they seemed to be for the prodigious child). Furthermore, <span class='bgasterisk'>***</span> BHSAD's most prodigious student has grown on us for his wittiness and a slight fondness for procrastination, mixed with a great sense of style and a good feeling for type, color and composition. Esquire welcomes you to get acquainted with this character in a 10 pages feature in our November issue.</div>
